Hi {user_name},

We have not received any events for "{tenant_name}" yet. This usually means the snippet is missing or blocked.

Quick checklist:
- Confirm the snippet is on every page you want tracked.
- Check that the public key matches your environment.
- Disable ad blockers and test again.

If you want to explore without installing, you can enable demo data in the dashboard.
